## Journal

Week 2:
Game theory based AI simulations

Hawk and Dove Evolution Simulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w

Hawk and Dove Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKjII7xCdk

Ant/Slime Simulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A

Week 3:
Made progress on prototype
- Added movement directions
- Did research into weighted random selections (for adding value to movement direction)
- Updated aesthetics of prototype

Week 4:
Clean up code for more understandable and simple rules

- Lose 1 energy every second
- Start with 10 energy
- If 0 energy, die
- If 30 energy - reproduce 
- Eat food for 1 energy
- Reproduction -> change size and speed by random amount (+/- 1_

Week 5:
Worked on research report, looking at developing genetic algorithm further and creating a useable/accessible product
Used the following sources:
SOURCE 1 – Youtube Video by Primer “Simulating Natural Selection” (Natural selection simulation)
SOURCE 2 - Misconceptions about evolution (Wanting to make a game to address/educate about evolution) 
SOURCE 3 – Mice Breeding/Evolution Simulation (How traits are selected (by hawks vision) and how traits are passed down)
SOURCE 4 – Genetic Algorithms tutorial (implementing above into practice)  
SOURCE 5 – Modelling Life textbook (specifically part about predator/prey population dynamics
SOURCE 6 - My prototype

Also worked on different algorithms for pathfinding 

Week 6/7 - Worked on report and presentation 

Week 8 - reevaulating project want to create a Chess AI
